grading based on:
- project design (images help)
- tradeoffs, choices and why?
- description of flow of control within submission
- explain tests you've developed and tests you've used by didn't develop
- this should be every bit of code that you used but did not write, this includes code, show off resources used (articles), 
    Thus, this would include articles on Stack Overflow, any repositories you referenced on github.com, any
    books you used, any manual pages you consulted
In addition, you have an opportunity to earn extra credit.  To do so, we want to see something that
adds value to the project.  Observing that there is a problem or issue _is not enough_.  We want
something that is easily actioned.  Examples of this include:
- Suggestions for additional tests, along with an explanation of _how_ you envision it being tested
- Suggested revisions to the instructions, code, comments, etc.  It's not enough to say "I found
  this confusing" - we want you to tell us what you would have said _instead_.
While we do award extra credit, we do so sparingly.
